# Snowflake SQL Challenge
I use my Snowflake Trial to execute a query that returns a single row according to these factors :

Write the query that only returns the email_address column
Join the tables together using the join_id column present in both tables
Column_1 needs to be divisible by 2 without creating a decimal number (or modulo)
column_2 needs to be smaller then column_1
Column_3 needs to end with a 1

- This should result in an email-address
